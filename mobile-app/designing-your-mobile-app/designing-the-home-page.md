# Designing the Home Page

The mobile app's home page is fully customisable. You can change the app bar's colour and adjust its height. Additionally, you have the option to choose a background image instead of a colour.

Let's customise the home page of your mobile app.

1. On the Lucy web app homepage, go to the **Mobile App** tab. Mobile app builder screen displays.
2. Under the **General** tab on the right, go to the **Home Page** tab.
3. Customise the settings of the homepage as necessary.
4. Click **Save** to apply the changes in the mobile app.
5. Open the mobile app to view changes.
