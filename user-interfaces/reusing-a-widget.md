# Reusing a Widget

You can save an existing user-created widget as a Template. These templates act as a foundation for building customised widgets.

For example, if you want to create a widget similar to one you've previously designed but with a different data source, you can easily start from a saved template.

Sometimes it can be a form, a You Tube card you want to reuse.

### Access Your Saved Widget Templates

Now, whenever you need to create a new widget similar to one you've already designed, you can easily use a saved widget template. Any type of widget you've created, such as a Form, Simple Card, Radial Gauge, can be saved as a template for future use.

All your saved templates can be accessed from the "My Templates" tab in the "Select a Template" window.
