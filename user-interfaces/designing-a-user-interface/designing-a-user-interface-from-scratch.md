# Designing a User Interface from Scratch

This article is intended to guide you on creating and customizing your own widget using a pre-built template.

A UI template functions as a pre-designed blueprint, offering users a starting point to craft a personalized user interface tailored to their specific needs. Once you've chosen a template, you have the flexibility to make necessary adjustments, altering the widget's appearance by modifying elements such as colors, text, background images, and more.
