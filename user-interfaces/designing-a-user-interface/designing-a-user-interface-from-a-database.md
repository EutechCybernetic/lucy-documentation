# Designing a User Interface from a Database

This article shows how to design a form from a database.

The purpose of these forms is to simplify data collection, streamline processes, and enhance communication between users and organisations. By capturing and storing data in a database, businesses and organisations can better manage and utilise the information for diverse purposes, including providing services, making informed decisions, and improving user experiences. For instance, consider feedback forms.

**Tip**: When designing a user interface to capture information using a Form, you can always start from scratch, yet it is generally advisable to start creating a form from a database.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip**: Once you open the widget designer, its default mode will be the **Design** Mode (design mode will be selected).

There are two modes in a widget designer page:&#x20;

2. **Preview mode** - Used to view a live version of the widget.
{% endhint %}

### <mark style="color:blue;">3. Using Widget Designer to Customise the Form</mark>

The Widget Designer offers a user-friendly interface for designing, editing, and customising your widgets. This functionality empowers users to tailor the appearance, behavior, and content of their widgets to meet specific needs.

To customise the form's appearance, including elements such as the header, body, or individual items/fields within the body, simply click on the desired section. This action opens the Properties panel, allowing you to make adjustments like changing the header background.
