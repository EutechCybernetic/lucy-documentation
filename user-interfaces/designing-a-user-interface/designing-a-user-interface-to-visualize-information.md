# Designing a User Interface to Visualize Information

Designing user interfaces to visualize data is a powerful way to derive meaningful insights. Depending on the data and the user's goals, designers choose appropriate visualization types, which can include charts, graphs, maps and more.

&#x20;This article shows how to design a user interface to visualize your data and explains the two distinct approaches to do that:

1. [Visualizing Data by Selecting a Data source](designing-a-user-interface-to-visualize-information.md#id-1.-visualizing-data-by-selecting-a-data-source)
2. [Starting from Scratch by Selecting a Template](designing-a-user-interface-to-visualize-information.md#selecting-a-data-source)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: Before you go ahead with any of these methods, ensure that a data source (database/workflow) is ready in the system.
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:blue;">1. Visualizing Data by Selecting a Data source</mark>

Before designing a user interface for data visualization, the first step is to select a data source. This could involve choosing a workflow or a database to obtain the data that will be visualized.

To illustrate the concept, we'll design a user interface that displays the maximum sales for each product line with the status 'Shipped' and we'll choose a database as the data source.

### <mark style="color:blue;">a) Selecting a Data source</mark>

To select a data source:

1. On the app **homepage**, go to the **My Work** tab on the left sidebar.
2. Search and select the **folder** you wish to open.
3. Go to the **User Interfaces** tab.
4. Click on the **Add** button.
5. Choose the **Visualize Data** option.
6. Select the **data source**. You can either select a workflow or a database as the data source.
7. For instance, letâ€™s select an existing database.
   1. To select an existing database, head to the **Databases** tab. All the databases created in the system will be listed categorized by its folder.
   2. Choose and click on the required **database**. Alternatively, you can use search box to search and filter databases.
   3. A preview displaying the available fields of the chosen database will be listed.
   4. To confirm the selection, click **Select this source** .
   5. A table preview of the selected database will be displayed.

### <mark style="color:blue;">b) Preparing Data to be Visualized</mark>

You can determine the specific data to display on the widget by utilizing features like data filtering and aggregation. We'll apply a filter to isolate product lines with a 'Shipped' status and then display the maximum sales for each respective product line from the previously selected database.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">Filtering Data</mark>

Filtering data is used to extract a subset of data that meets specific criteria or conditions. It helps in narrowing down the dataset to focus on a particular subset of interest.

1. On the table preview, click **Filter Data.**
2. Click **Add** button to add a new filter condition.&#x20;
3. You can add multiple conditions to filter your data.
   1. To add multiple filter conditions, click **Add** button _e.g., To have two filter conditions, click the Add button twice._&#x20;
   2. To filter data by selecting one condition or any other condition, click **Either** button.
   3. To filter data by selecting all the conditions added, click **All** button.
4. Select appropriate fields, operation and values for the respective condition (s).
5. After applying the condition (s), click **Done**.
6. Based on the conditions applied, the data will be filtered and listed.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/LC_Designing a user interface to visualize information_s2.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Filter your data screen 1</p></figcaption></figure>

#### <mark style="color:blue;">Adding Group of Conditions</mark>

When dealing with complex datasets, a single condition may not be sufficient. Grouping conditions enables you to create more sophisticated filters, combining multiple criteria to obtain the desired subset of data.



{% hint style="info" %}
For our example, adding group of conditions is not needed.
{% endhint %}

1. On the table preview, click **Filter Data.**
2. Click the **Filter** button to add a new group of conditions. Tip: Repeat step 2 to add more group of conditions.
3. Within the newly added group of conditions, click **Add** button to add a new filter condition inside it. Tip: Repeat step 3 to add more conditions under respective group of conditions.
4. Within a group of conditions, you can include multiple group of conditions. Click the **Filter** button inside a group of conditions to add multiple group of conditions inside the respective group.
5. To filter data by selecting one condition or any other condition, click **Either** button.
6. To filter data by selecting all the conditions added, click **All** button.
7. After applying the conditions, click **Done**.
8. Based on the conditions applied, the data will be filtered and listed.

{% hint style="success" %}
Within a group of conditions, you can include multiple conditions.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/LC_Designing a user interface to visualize information_s4.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Filtered data</p></figcaption></figure>

#### <mark style="color:blue;">Aggregating Data</mark>

Aggregating data is used to summarize and condense data into a more compact form, often achieved by mathematical or statistical operations (_e.g., Aggregating data to find the maximum sales for each product line)._

1. On the table preview, click **Aggregate Data**.&#x20;
2. Select appropriate filters to aggregate data.
3. Click **Done**. Based on the aggregation, the data will be aggregated and listed.
4. If you are happy with the aggregation, click **Looks good.**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/LC_Designing a user interface to visualize information_s7.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A preview of your aggregated data</p></figcaption></figure>

### <mark style="color:blue;">c) Selecting a Template</mark>

After selecting a data source and preparing data as needed, you can select a template to begin customization. Based on the data selected, the system will display a list of matching templates that work with those data.

For example, we'll select the Bar/Line chart template from the available template list.

1. Select the desired type of **Template** to display data _e.g., Bar/Line chart._
2. Click **Edit this template**. The respective template will be displayed on widget designer page.
3. By default, **Design** mode will be selected on the widget designer page.



{% hint style="info" %}
There are two mode for a widget designer page:

1\) Design mode - Used to design, edit, and customize the widget.

2\) Preview mode - Used to view a live version of the widget.
{% endhint %}

### <mark style="color:blue;">d) Customizing the Widget</mark>

A Bar/Line chart can be customized to meet the user's needs by adjusting its appearance, changing the way data is presented (e.g., selecting different chart types), customizing legends, axis labels and other elements to provide context and improve the understanding of the presented information.

There are 3 types of charts you can have in a Bar/Line chart :&#x20;

* Line chart&#x20;
* Bar chart
* Area chart

You can choose either a single chart type or multiple chart types to display on the same chart. For example, you can have both a bar chart and a line chart on a single chart.



<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/LC_Designing a user interface to visualize information_s9.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Chart Types</p></figcaption></figure>

#### <mark style="color:blue;">Selecting a Single Chart Type</mark>

### <mark style="color:blue;">Binding a Data source</mark>

Once you've chosen the right template, you can then determine which data source to associate with the widget. A data source provides the raw data that the widget visualizes. Without a data source, there's no information to present visually.

To bind a data source to the widget:

1. Click **Data source is required** option and click **Bind a Source** button.
2. As the data source, you can either select a workflow or a database to obtain data to be visualized.
3. For instance, letâ€™s select an existing database.
   * Click **Databases** tab. All the databases created in the system will be listed categorized by its folder.
   * Select and click on the required **database**. Alternatively, you can use search box to search and filter the database.
   * A preview of the available fields of the selected database will be listed.
   * Click **Select this source**.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">Preparing Data to be Visualized</mark>

Next, step is to customize how you want to visualize data on the widget.
