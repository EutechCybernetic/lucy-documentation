# Customising a Canvas

Beyond customising individual widgets, you can personalise your canvas further by:

* **Adding sidebar items:** Organize your content into sections and sub-sections, making it easier for users to navigate and find the information they need.
* **Branding your canvas:** Incorporate your logo and customise the colors of the sidebar and canvas header.
* **Managing access:** Control which user groups or individuals can view specific sidebar items or the entire canvas.

Sidebar items/links help you to navigate to different pages in your canvas.

There are two ways to create a sidebar item on your canvas.

1. Create a New Sidebar Item
2. Select from Existing Item
