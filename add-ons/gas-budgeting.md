# Gas Budgeting

Gas Budgeting is the process of setting and managing budgets of gas consumption in a building or workplace. This involves determining the amount of gas expected to be used over a specific period, and then tracking actual gas consumption against this budget. Gas budgeting can help organizations manage their energy costs more effectively, identify areas for potential energy savings, and reduce their overall carbon footprint.

**Gas Budgeting Add-on**

The Gas Budgeting add-on simplifies the monitoring of gas consumption, letting you to create customised, out-of-the-box canvases/dashboards.

**Gas Categories**

Gas Categories refers to different types of gas sources or consumption. For example, Cooking and Boilers. There can be different meters that track different circuits to measure this usage.

However, in environments where such detailed metering is not available, overall gas consumption can be captured using a single category.

This process involves three main steps:

1. [Installing the Gas Budgeting Add-on](gas-budgeting.md#installing-the-gas-budgeting-add-on)
2. [Configuring the Gas Budgeting Add-on](gas-budgeting.md#configuring-the-gas-budgeting-add-on)
3. [Creating a Canvas](gas-budgeting.md#creating-a-canvas)
