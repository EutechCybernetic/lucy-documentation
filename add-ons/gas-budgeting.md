# Gas Budgeting

Gas Budgeting is the process of setting and managing budgets of gas consumption in a building or workplace. This involves determining the amount of water expected to be used over a specific period, and then tracking actual water consumption against this budget. Gas budgeting can help organizations manage their energy costs more effectively, identify areas for potential energy savings, and reduce their overall carbon footprint.
