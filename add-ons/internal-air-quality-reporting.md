# Internal Air Quality Reporting

**Internal Air Quality (IAQ)**

Internal Air Quality (IAQ) data refers to the information collected from monitoring various factors that affect the quality of indoor air. This data typically includes measurements of parameters such as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, etc.

**Importance of Monitoring and Maintaining IAQ Data**

* **Health and Comfort:** Poor IAQ can lead to health issues such as respiratory problems, allergies, and headaches. By monitoring IAQ data, building occupants can be aware of the air they breath and take necessary precautions to mitigate potential health risks.
* **Productivity:** Good IAQ is linked to improved cognitive function and productivity. Monitoring IAQ data can help create a healthier and more comfortable indoor environment, leading to higher productivity levels among occupants.
* **Energy Efficiency:** Proper ventilation and control of indoor air pollutants can improve energy efficiency by reducing the need for excessive heating, cooling, and ventilation.
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Many jurisdictions have regulations and guidelines in place to ensure indoor air quality meets certain standards. Monitoring IAQ data helps ensure compliance with these regulations.
* **Building Maintenance:** IAQ data can also help identify issues with building systems, such as ventilation systems or building materials, that may need maintenance or replacement to improve indoor air quality.
