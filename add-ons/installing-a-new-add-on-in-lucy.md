# Installing a New Add-on in Lucy

This article explains how to install a new add-on in Lucy.

By default, widgets are part of an add-on. When you install a widget that requires an add-on, you will be asked to install that add-on. Once the add-on is installed, all the widgets within it become available. Depending on the add-on, this configuration may change.

Now, there are two ways to install a new add-on:

1. [Installing an Add-on from a Dashboard/Canvas](installing-a-new-add-on-in-lucy.md#installing-an-add-on-from-a-dashboard-canvas)
2. [Installing an Add-on from the Add-ons Page](installing-a-new-add-on-in-lucy.md#installing-an-add-on-from-the-add-ons-page)

Installing an add-on may be necessary for certain widgets on your dashboard. The simplest way to do this is to install it directly from the dashboard, eliminating the need to navigate back and forth.

To install add-on from a dashboard:

1. On the app **homepage**, head to the **Gallery** tab on the left.
2. Pick the Canvas from the Gallery.
3. If there is a list of Canvases on the Gallery, you can search for the required Canvas by typing its name under **Search Canvases**.
4. Click on the canvas you wish to open.
5. On the canvas, pick the widget you wish to install the add-on.
6. Click the **Install** button of the respective widget.

After completing the installation, a sequence of configuration steps will guide you to set up the add-on. Once the configuration is done, the data will be displayed on your widget.
