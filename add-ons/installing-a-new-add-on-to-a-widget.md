# Installing a New Add-on to a Widget

This article explains how to install a new add-on to a widget.

By default, Add-ons are part of a widget. Some widgets added to your canvas might require add-ons to be installed and configured in order to display data. Depending on the add-on, this configuration may change.

Now, there are two ways to install a new add-on to a widget:

1. Installing an Add-on from a Dashboard/Canvas
2. Install an Add-on from the Add-ons Page
