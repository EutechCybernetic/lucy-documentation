# Energy Budgeting

Energy budgeting refers to the process of setting and managing budgets for energy consumption within a building or workplace. This involves determining the amount of energy expected to be used over a specific period, and then tracking actual energy consumption against this budget. Monitoring energy usage is essential for organizations looking to manage their energy consumption more effectively, reduce costs, and improve their environmental impact.

**Energy Budgeting Add-on**

Lucy’s Energy Budgeting add-on allows you to track the energy consumption across multiple buildings and energy categories.

**Energy Categories**

Energy Categories represent different types of energy consumption in a building. For example, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) accounts for the energy used for heating, cooling, and ventilation systems. There can be different meters that track different circuits that measure electricity.

&#x20;However, in environments where such detailed metering is not available, overall energy consumption can be captured using a single category.

This article explains how to track your energy consumption and compare it to your budget with Lucy’s Energy Budgeting Add-on.

This process involves three main steps:

1. Installing the Energy Budgeting Add-on
2. Configuring the Energy Budgeting Add-on
3. Creating Your Canvas/Dashboard

### 1. Installing the Energy Budgeting Add-on

### 2. Configuring the Energy Budgeting Add-on

After the installation is completed, you will be directed to the configuration page. This step involves configuring energy categories and budgets and connecting meters.&#x20;

To configure the add-on:

1. On the app **homepage**, click the **Add-ons** tab. Add-ons page will open.
2. Click on the **Energy Budgeting** add-on. A configuration wizard will open.
3. Go to **Setup Budgets and Categories** tab.
4. Add a new Energy Category.
   1. Click the **+** button.
   2. **Category Name**: Give a name for the category, _e.g., HVAC, Lighting._
   3. Click **Save**. A new category will be created and listed under Setup Budgets and Categories tab.
   4. Create multiple categories if you have meters to track different types of energy consumption.
5. Configure energy consumption budgets for all the newly added categories.
   1. Click on a category.
   2. Type in the budget values for each month of the year.
   3. Click **Save**.
6. Connect meters. There are three ways to feed actual energy consumption data to the system.
   1. **Get Smart Meters**: Connect smart meters to automatically send energy consumption data in.
   2. &#x20;**Buy on Spacewox:** Buy smart meters from Spaceworx marketplace
   3. **Manually Upload Energy data:** Upload energy consumption data manually
7. We will pick **Manually Upload Energy data** option.
8. Select the **Date** for the month you want to add energy data.
9. Type in the actual consumption for each category you have created for the selected month.
10. Click **Save**.
11. Repeat steps 7 to 10 to add more data.
