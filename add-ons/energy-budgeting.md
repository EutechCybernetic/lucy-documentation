# Energy Budgeting

Energy budgeting refers to the process of setting and managing budgets for energy consumption within a building or workplace. This involves determining the amount of energy expected to be used over a specific period, and then tracking actual energy consumption against this budget. Monitoring energy usage is essential for organizations looking to manage their energy consumption more effectively, reduce costs, and improve their environmental impact.

**Energy Budgeting Add-on**

Lucy’s Energy Budgeting add-on allows you to track the energy consumption across multiple buildings and energy categories.

**Energy Categories**

Energy Categories represent different types of energy consumption in a building. For example, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) accounts for the energy used for heating, cooling, and ventilation systems. There can be different meters that track different circuits that measure electricity.

&#x20;However, in environments where such detailed metering is not available, overall energy consumption can be captured using a single category.

This article explains how to track your energy consumption and compare it to your budget with Lucy’s Energy Budgeting Add-on.

This process involves three main steps:

1. Installing the Energy Budgeting Add-on
2. Configuring the Energy Budgeting Add-on
3. Creating Your Canvas/Dashboard
