# Energy Budgeting

Energy budgeting refers to the process of setting and managing budgets for energy consumption within a building or workplace. This involves determining the amount of energy expected to be used over a specific period and then tracking actual energy consumption against this budget. Monitoring energy usage is essential for organizations looking to manage their energy consumption more effectively, reduce costs, and improve their environmental impact.

**Energy Budgeting Add-on**

Lucy’s Energy Budgeting add-on allows you to track the energy consumption across multiple buildings and energy categories.

**Energy Categories**

Energy Categories represent different types of energy sources or consumption in a building. For example, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. There can be different meters that track different circuits that measure these types.

However, in environments where such detailed metering is not available, overall energy consumption can be captured using a single category.

## Monitoring Energy Consumption

This article explains how to track your energy consumption and compare it to your budget with Lucy’s Energy Budgeting Add-on.

This process involves three main steps:

1. [Installing the Energy Budgeting Add-on](energy-budgeting.md#id-1.-installing-the-energy-budgeting-add-on)
2. [Configuring the Energy Budgeting Add-on](energy-budgeting.md#id-2.-configuring-the-energy-budgeting-add-on)
3. [Creating Your Canvas](energy-budgeting.md#id-3.-creating-your-canvas)

   1. Click the **+** button.
   2. **Category Name**: Give a name for the category, _e.g., HVAC, Lighting._
   3. Click **Save**. A new category will be created and listed under Setup Budgets and Categories tab.
   4. Create multiple categories if you have meters to track different types of energy consumption.
5. Configure energy consumption budgets for all the newly added categories.
   1. Click on a category.
   2. Type in the budget values for each month of the year.
   3. Click **Save**.
6. Connect meters. There are three ways to feed actual energy consumption data to the system.
   1. **Get Smart Meters**: Connect smart meters to automatically send energy consumption data in.
   2. &#x20;**Buy on Spacewox:** Buy smart meters from Spaceworx marketplace.
   3. **Manually Upload Energy data:** Upload energy consumption data manually.
   4. Go to **Connect Meters** tab.&#x20;
   5. We will pick **Manually Upload Energy data** option.
   6. Select the **Date** for the month you want to add energy data.
   7. Type in the actual consumption for each category you have created.
   8. Click **Save**.
   9. Click **Manually Upload Energy data** option to add more data.

### 3. Creating Your Canvas

&#x20;The last step is to create a canvas to monitor energy consumption.

To create a canvas:

   6. Enable the Blur the background option to blur the applied background of your Canvas if necessary.
5. Provide a suitable unique **Name** for the canvas.
6. Grant Access to the Canvas.
   1. Select a User Group (e.g., System Administrators) if you wish to grant access to specific groups.
   2. Skip the User Group selection if you intend to allow access for everyone.
7. Click **Next**. A new Canvas will be created.
8. Click **Go to your Canvas now** button to launch it in a new window.
9. Pick and add energy related widgets on to your canvas.
   1. Click **+** button. Widget Browser will open.
   2. Use the Search box to search and filter required widgets by typing widget’s name/partial name, _e.g., energy._
   3. We will select, **Current Monthly Energy Usage, Energy Consumption (Category-wise) and Yearly Energy Consumption** widgets.
   4. Click **Add Widgets.** Widgets will be added to the canvas. Initially, you will not see data in the widgets.
10. Filter and display data in the Monthly Energy Usage widget. This widget displays current month’s consumption.
    1. Select the Monthly Energy Usage widget.
    2. Click **Filter** icon.
    3. Pick the applicable **location**.
    4. Select the required **Category** _e.g., HVAC_.
    5. The widget will display the current month’s consumption for the selected category.
