# Water Budgeting

Water Budgeting allows monitoring water consumption in a building or a workplace and set budgets. This involves determining the amount of water expected to be used over a specific period, and then tracking actual water consumption against this budget. Water budgeting helps organizations monitor and control their water usage, identify areas where water conservation measures can be implemented, and ultimately reduce water waste and costs.

**Water Budgeting Add-on**

Lucy's Water Budgeting add-on simplifies the monitoring of your water consumption, letting you to create customized, out-of-the-box canvases/dashboards.

**Water Categories**

Water Categories represent different types of water sources or consumption in a building. For example, domestic use, landscaping, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. There can be different meters that track different circuits to measure these types.

However, in environments where such detailed metering is not available, overall water consumption can be captured using a single category.
