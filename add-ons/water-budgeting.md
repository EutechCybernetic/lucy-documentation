# Water Budgeting

This involves determining the amount of water expected to be used over a specific period, and then tracking actual water consumption against this budget. Water budgeting helps organizations monitor and control their water usage, identify areas where water conservation measures can be implemented, and ultimately reduce water waste and costs.
