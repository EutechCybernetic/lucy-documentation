# Occupancy Analytics

The Occupancy Analytics add-on lets you create custom canvases/dashboards to track the utilization of spaces and rooms. By using this add-on, you can monitor how different areas are being used and make informed decisions about space planning and resource allocation.

To get started, weâ€™ll create a canvas to track occupancy data and then install and configure the Occupancy Analytics add-on right from there.
