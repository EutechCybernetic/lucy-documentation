# Occupancy Analytics

Occupancy analytics refers to the process of analyzing and understanding how spaces within a building or facility are utilized. This analysis typically involves tracking metrics such as the number of people in a space and patterns of space usage over time. Occupancy analytics can provide valuable insights into how spaces are being used, helping organizations optimize their use of space, improve efficiency, and enhance the overall experience for occupants.

**Occupancy Analytics Add-on**

The Occupancy Analytics add-on lets you create custom canvases/dashboards to track the utilization of spaces and rooms. By using this add-on, you can monitor how different areas are being used and make informed decisions about space planning and resource allocation.

To get started, we’ll create a canvas to track occupancy data and then install and configure the Occupancy Analytics add-on right from there.

### Create Your Canvas

To create a new canvas:

1. On the Lucy app **homepage,** click the **Gallery** tab.
2. Click the **+** button to start creating a new Canvas.
3. Click **Next**.
4. Customize the background  of the canvas if needed.
   1. To select a color theme for your Canvas from the pre-selected color themes, click on the required box. Selected colour theme will be shown under the Header Colour section.
