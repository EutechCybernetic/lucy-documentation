# Creating a User Group

User Groups bundle together permissions, dictating which features specific users can access within the Lucy app.

Let's create a User Group.

1. On the app **homepage**, click the profile image icon and go to **Settings**.
2. Click the **Plus** icon.
3. Enter a suitable name for the user group, _e.g., Property Manager._
4. Choose an existing user group to copy permissions from.
5. Click **Save** and the user group will be created.
6. Then User Group Configuration window opens.
7. Under Permissions section, select or deselect the required permissions as necessary.
8. By default, when you log in to the Lucy app, you’ll land on the usual homepage. Instead, you can select a  specific canvas to land on upon login.
9. To land on a certain canvas upon log in:
   1. Select the ‘**Enter a custom URL’** checkbox.
   2. Type in the **URL** to that canvas.
   3. Click **Update**.
10. To land on usual Lucy app homepage upon log in:
    1. Deselect the ‘**Enter a custom URL’** checkbox.
    2. Click **Update**.
