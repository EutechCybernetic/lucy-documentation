# Creating a User Group

User Groups bundle together permissions, dictating which features specific users can access within the Lucy app.

Let's create a User Group.

1. On the app **homepage**, click the profile image icon and go to **Settings**.
2. Click the **Plus** icon.
3. Enter a suitable name for the user group, _e.g., Property Manager._
4. Choose an existing user group to copy permissions from.
5. Click **Save** and the user group will be created. Then User Group Configuration window opens.
6. Under Permissions section, select or deselect the required permissions as necessary.
7. Under Homepage section, set up the homepage for the user group.
   1. By default, when you log in to the Lucy app, you’ll land on the usual homepage. You can continue with the default homepage settings.
   2. If you have canvases already created, and prefer to land on a specific canvas upon login, you can either enter the URL for the desired canvas, in the provided box. or deselect the ‘Enter a custom URL’ checkbox, and pick the name of the required Canvas.
   3. Instead, you can select a  specific canvas to land on upon logging in.
8. Click **Update** to save settings.
