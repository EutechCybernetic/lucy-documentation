There are two ways to add a widget onto a canvas.

1. [Adding a Widget onto Your Canvas](adding-widgets-onto-your-canvas.md#adding-a-widget-onto-your-canvas)
2. [Adding a Widget from the Widget Designer Page](adding-widgets-onto-your-canvas.md#adding-a-widget-from-the-widget-designer-page)

Here's an example of a widget: The Current Monthly Energy Usage widget. This widget can be used to display your energy consumption for the current month.

The process of adding a widget directly from your canvas is described in four main steps.

{% hint style="info" %}
You have the flexibility to add multiple instances of the same widget onto your canvas.
{% endhint %}

### <mark style="color:blue;">1</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">Open your Canvas</mark>

1. On the Lucy app's **homepage**, click the **Gallery** tab on the sidebar to go to the Gallery.
2. Pick the Canvas from the Gallery to add the widget(s).
3. If there is a list of Canvases on the Gallery, you can search for the required Canvas by typing its name under **Search Canvases**.
4. Click on the Canvas to view it in full, or alternatively, hover over the Canvas and click the **preview** icon![](<../.gitbook/assets/Preview icon.png>) to open it.
5. If you have not added any Widgets onto your Canvas yet, you will see the **+** icon . Click the **+** icon. The Widget Browser will open. Alternatively, you can click the **Add Widget** button on the top right to add widgets onto your Canvas.

### <mark style="color:blue;">2. Filter Widgets from the Widget Browser Window</mark>

The Widget Browser shows the available widgets for you to add to your Canvas. Already installed widgets will be displayed with a tag stating "**Installed"**.

To Filter and Select Widgets from the Widget Browser:

1. Select the Category from the list displayed on the Sidebar, to see the Widgets belong to the specific Category. Below are some categories you will find:
   1. All: Displays all available widgets.
   2. My Widgets: Displays the widgets designed by you and others.
   3. Facilities Management: Displays the widgets related to Facility Management.
2. You can search for the required Widget by typing the name in the box given on the top as well.

### <mark style="color:blue;">3. View Widget Preview</mark>

On the Widget Browser, click the Preview icon![](<../.gitbook/assets/Preview icon (1).png>) of the required Widget to get more information about the respective Widget. Once the preview icon is clicked, you will see a small preview of the Widget which is interactive.

3. Go to the **User Interfaces** tab.
4. Hover over the desired user interface and click the **Edit** icon. It will open on the widget designer page.
5. Click the **Share** button.
6. Under Add this to a Canvas section, pick the required canvas to add your widget.
7. Click **Add to Dashboard.**
8. Now your widget will be displayed on the respective canvas.
