# Workflows

Workflows enable the creation of automated sequences of actions that interact with various applications and devices, allowing for efficient and streamlined processes. These workflows consist of a trigger, which initiates the workflow, and a sequence of actions that are executed when the trigger event occurs.

Overall, automated workflows help organizations streamline their processes, improve efficiency, and ensure timely responses to important events.

For example, a workflow can be created to run whenever someone adds new data to a database. This trigger could then initiate the action such as inserting the data into a dedicated Excel sheet.

**Triggers**

A trigger is an event/condition that initiates the workflow. When the condition is met, the workflow will start to run. Triggers can be things like receiving an email, adding a new record to a database, or a specific time or interval.

**Actions**

Actions are the tasks or steps that the workflow performs in response to the trigger. These actions may talk to external systems that you have connected to your Lucy account. The actions could also interact with your database or other entities as well.

You can locate, access, and create your workflows through the **Workflows** tab within a specific folder.
