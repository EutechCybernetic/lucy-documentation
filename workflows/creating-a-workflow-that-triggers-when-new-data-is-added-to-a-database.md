# Creating a Workflow that triggers when New Data is added to a Database

Workflows are automated sequences of actions that connect different applications or services to streamline processes. A workflow typically starts with a trigger and then executes a series of actions in response to that trigger.

A workflow can be set up to trigger when new data is added to a certain database. In general, the system repeatedly monitors the database for new data entries. If new data entry is detected, the workflow is triggered, and a series of predefined actions are executed. These actions can include sending notifications, updating records, and more.

In this tutorial, we will create a simple workflow that automatically sends an email whenever new data is added to a database.
