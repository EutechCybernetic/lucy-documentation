# Using the Workflow Editor

The Workflow Editor offers an easy-to-use interface for creating and modifying workflows. It simplifies the process compared to the earlier 'Model Designer' in the Lucy app.

## Key Features in the Workflow Editor&#x20;

In the workflow editor, you create a workflow by connecting blocks together.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;Every workflow starts with a trigger block, followed by one or more action blocks.
{% endhint %}

Here are the key features in the Workflow Editor:

1. Trigger Blocks
2. Action Blocks

### **1. Trigger Blocks**

Trigger Blocks initiate the workflow process. They act as the starting point and are designed to respond to specific events or conditions. For example, a trigger block can be set up to activate when a new email is received, a form is submitted.

When you construct a workflow using the Workflow Editor, you'll encounter four distinct types of trigger blocks.

1. Cron Trigger Blocks
2. Message Trigger Block
3. Email Trigger Block
4. Database Trigger Blocks

#### Cron Trigger Blocks

Cron triggers allow you to schedule workflows to run at specific intervals.

_e.g., Schedule a workflow to run every hour_

These are the Cron Triggers available in Lucy.

#### Message Trigger Block

A message trigger is used to start workflows in response to messages from popular messaging applications _e.g., Telegram._ For example, you can set up a workflow to run whenever a message is received from a bot.

#### Email Trigger Block

Email trigger is used to start workflows when an email is sent by someone.

### 2. Action Blocks

Action Blocks are the steps that take place after a workflow has been triggered. Each action block performs a specific task, such as sending an email, updating a database record. You can string together multiple action blocks to create complex automations tailored to your needs.
