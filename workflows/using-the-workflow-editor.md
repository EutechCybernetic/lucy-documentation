# Using the Workflow Editor

The Workflow Editor offers an easy-to-use interface for creating and modifying workflows. It simplifies the process compared to the earlier 'Model Designer' in the Lucy app.

## Key Features in the Workflow Editor&#x20;

In the workflow editor, you create a workflow by connecting blocks together.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;Every workflow starts with a trigger block, followed by one or more action blocks.
{% endhint %}

Here are the key features in the Workflow Editor:

1. Trigger Blocks
2. Action Blocks

### **Trigger Blocks**

Trigger Blocks initiate the workflow process. They act as the starting point and are designed to respond to specific events or conditions. For example, a trigger block can be set up to activate when a new email is received, a form is submitted.

There are four types of trigger blocks you will find when creating a workflow using the Workflow Editor.

1. Cron Trigger Blocks
2. Message Trigger Blocks
3. Email Trigger Blocks
4. Database Trigger Blocks

#### Cron Trigger Blocks



### Action Blocks

Action Blocks are the steps that take place after a workflow has been triggered. Each action block performs a specific task, such as sending an email, updating a database record. You can string together multiple action blocks to create complex automations tailored to your needs.
