# Creating a Workflow that Runs at Specified Intervals

Automating tasks is essential for optimizing your workflow. One powerful method of automation is scheduling tasks to run at specified intervals. Scheduled workflows are a powerful way to automate repetitive tasks at regular intervals. They allow you to set up actions to be performed automatically, without manual intervention, saving time and reducing the risk of errors.&#x20;

You can set your workflow to run:

* every minute
* every five minutes
* every hour
* every day at midnight

For instance, let's create a simple workflow that sends an email every hour using the Workflow Editor. The following steps will help you create the workflow.

## 1. Creating the Workflow

1. On Lucy app **homepage**, click on the **My Work** tab on the left.
2. All the folders/projects you have created, as well as those created by others, will be listed.&#x20;
3. Click on the folder to open it.
