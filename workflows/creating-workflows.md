# Creating Workflows

Workflows enable the creation of automated sequences of actions that interact with various applications, allowing for efficient and streamlined processes. A workflow is initiated by a trigger event, followed by the execution of predetermined actions in response to that event.

Users can easily create their workflows using the Workflow Editor. Using the Workflow Editor, you can create workflows that start when:

1. Data is added to a database
2. You receive an email
3. You receive a message from chatbot
4. The workflow is initiated at specified intervals

## 1. Creating a Workflow to Run When new Data is Added to a Database

Creating a workflow that activates when new data is added to a database is incredibly useful for real-time data processing, ensuring that your system reacts promptly to new information without manual intervention.

## 4. Creating a Workflow that Runs at Specified Intervals

To automate processes at regular times or intervals, you can create scheduled workflows. These workflows are particularly useful for routine tasks like data backups, daily reports, or periodic data analysis. You can configure such a workflow to run (e.g., every 5 minutes), depending on your needs.
