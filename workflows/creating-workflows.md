# Creating Workflows

Workflows enable the creation of automated sequences of actions that interact with various applications, allowing for efficient and streamlined processes. These workflows consist of a trigger, which initiates the workflow, and a sequence of actions that are executed when the trigger event occurs.

Users can easily create their workflows using the Workflow Editor. Using the Workflow Editor, you can create workflows that start when:

1. Data is added to a database
2. You receive an email
3. You receive a message from chatbot
4. An event is created in your calendar
5. The workflow is initiated at specified intervals
