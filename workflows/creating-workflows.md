# Creating Workflows

Workflows enable the creation of automated sequences of actions that interact with various applications, allowing for efficient and streamlined processes. These workflows consist of a trigger, which initiates the workflow, and a sequence of actions that are executed when the trigger event occurs.

Workflows can be designed and created from the workflow editor.

There are various ways to create a workflow using the Workflow Editor. Using the Workflow Editor, you can create workflows that start/trigger when:

1. Data is added to a database
2. You receive an email
3. You receive a message from a chatbot
4. The workflow is initiated at specified intervals
