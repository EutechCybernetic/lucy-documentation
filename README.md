# Introduction to Lucy

Welcome to the Lucy Training Center.

This training center is designed to be a self-service learning process for understanding and using Lucy.

This can be used on its own to learn the basics of Lucy and how it works and how to build solutions with it.

You can also obtain a more tailored and person-to-person training process if you need.

However, we suggest you start here.

There are two editions of Lucy:

1. Lucy Canvas - Designed to be simple to use is more focused on creating dashboards and user interfaces with integrations and data
2. Lucy Pro - The core integration middleware component of Lucy

This training section currently focuses on Lucy Canvas.
