Adjusting the widget’s settings enables users to personalize the visual representation of the data, making it more tailored to their preferences or specific needs. This involves actions like changing the color code for the baseline, changing the color code for the cumulative budget, and editing the axis labels in the Yearly Water Consumption Budget vs Actual widget.

Let's see how to configure a widget's settings.

1. On the app homepage, head to the **Gallery** tab on the left sidebar.
2. Pick the Canvas from the Gallery.&#x20;
3. If there is a list of Canvases in the Gallery, you can search for the required Canvas by typing its name/partial name of your canvas under Search Canvases.&#x20;
