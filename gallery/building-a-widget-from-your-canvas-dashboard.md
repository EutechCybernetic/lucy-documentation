# Building a Widget from Your Canvas/Dashboard

If you can't find that specific widget on the widget browser, no worriesâ€”you can just build it yourself!

After building it, you can always add it to your canvas later at any time.

**What is a Widget Browser?**

A widget browser is a interface that allows users to explore, search, and discover various widgets when selecting widgets to be added to a dashboard. In addition, widget browser allows to generate new widgets when none meet their specified criteria.
