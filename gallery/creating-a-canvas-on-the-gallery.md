## <mark style="color:blue;">Canvas</mark>

In Lucy, a **Canvas** is your space or dashboard where you can add widgets to create and organize your work, and visualize your data. You can see all your Canvases, as well as the Canvases created by others by going to the **Gallery** tab on the sidebar in Lucy.&#x20;

   2. If you need to select a custom color theme, click on the color code in the **Header Color** section to open the color picker to select a color of your own.
5. Under **Background Image**, click the **Search** icon to select a background wallpaper for your Canvas.
   1. To select an image from the available collection, first, type the required keyword in the **Search Images** box to search for the image and then select it.
   2. To select your own image as the background of your Canvas, click **Upload your image** and upload your own image.
6. Enable the **Blur the background** option to blur the applied background of your Canvas if necessary.
7. Click **Next**.
8. Provide a **Name** for your Canvas.
9. Grant Access to the Canvas.
   1. Select a User Group (e.g., System Administrators) if you wish to grant access to specific groups.
   2. Skip the User Group selection if you intend to allow access for everyone.
10. Click **Next**. A new Canvas will be created and listed on the Gallery page.&#x20;
11. Click **Go to your Canvas now** button to jump into your Canvas. The newly created Canvas will open in a new tab in your browser.

> **Note:** You can always change the properties of the canvas, such as **Color Theme**, **Background Image**, and **Name**, later at any time.
