# Filtering Data in a Widget

Most widgets added to your canvas come with a Filter option. This feature allows users to customize the widget's view, enabling them to focus on and display only the data that is relevant to them within the context of the widget.

Let's see how to filter data in a widget.

1. On the Lucy app's **homepage**, click the **Gallery** tab on the sidebar to go to the Gallery.
2. Pick the Canvas from the Gallery.
3. If there is a list of Canvases on the Gallery, you can search for the required Canvas by typing its name under **Search Canvases**.
4. Click on the selected canvas to open it.
5. Select the specific widget you'd like to filter data on.
6. Click the **Filter** icon on the respective widget.&#x20;
7. Apply the appropriate filters to refine data displayed on the widget.
