# Resizing a Widget on a Canvas

Resizing a widget on a canvas refers to the action of adjusting the dimensions or size of the widget within the canvas space. This involves increasing or decreasing the widget's width and height, to better fit the layout and design preferences of the user.

Some widgets reveal additional information when resized.
