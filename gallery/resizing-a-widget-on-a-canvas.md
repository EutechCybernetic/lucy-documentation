# Resizing a Widget on a Canvas

Resizing a widget on a canvas refers to the action of adjusting the dimensions or size of the widget within the canvas space. This can involve increasing or decreasing the widget's width, height, or both, to better fit the layout and design preferences of the user.

Some widgets reveal additional information when resized.

Let's see how to resize a widget on your canvas.
