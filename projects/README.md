# Projects

Projects or folders act as containers, encompassing all your creations, including notes, databases, workflows, and user interfaces. They play a crucial role in systematically organizing and structuring your content, streamlining file management for users.

You can create as many folders as you like to organize your work within Lucy.

Users can locate and access their projects through the **My Work** tab.
