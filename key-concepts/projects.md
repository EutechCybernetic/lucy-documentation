# Projects

Projects/Folders serve as containers that house all of your creations, encompassing Notes, Databases, Workflows, and User Interfaces. They play a vital role in systematically organizing and structuring your content, facilitating efficient file management for users. Lucy allows users to generate an unlimited number of folders, providing a flexible means to organize their work effectively.

Within every folder, you'll find five primary tabs outlined below:

1. **Notes**
2. **Databases**
3. **Workflows**
4. **User Interfaces**
5. **Ask me something**

<table><thead><tr><th width="342">Tabs inside a folder</th><th>Description</th><th data-hidden>Description</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Notes</td><td>Contains textual details about the contents within the folder</td><td>Keeps notes (some textual information) related to a folder.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Databases</td><td>Contains databases created related to a folder. Databases are document-based schema-less storage containers for any kind of data you want.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Workflows</td><td>Stores workflows created within a specific folder. Workflows enable the creation of automated sequences of actions that interact with various applications, allowing for efficient and streamlined processes. A workflow is initiated by a trigger event, followed by the execution of predetermined actions in response to that event.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>User Interfaces</td><td>Contains user interfaces created related to a specific folder. User Interfaces can be used to represent something on display.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ask me something</td><td>Used to build a widget based on a question entered related to the databases inside a specific folder</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
