# Projects

Projects/Folders serve as containers that house all of your creations, that encompass Notes, Databases, Workflows, and User Interfaces. They play a vital role in systematically organizing and structuring your content, facilitating efficient file management for users.

Lucy allows users to generate an unlimited number of folders, providing a flexible means to organize their work effectively.

Within every folder, you'll find four primary tabs outlined below:

1. **Notes**
2. **Databases**
3. **Workflows**
4. **User Interfaces**
5. **Ask me something**

<table><thead><tr><th>Tabs inside a folder</th><th>Description</th><th data-hidden>Description</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Notes</td><td>Contains textual details about the contents within the folder.</td><td>Keeps notes (some textual information) related to a folder.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Databases</td><td>Contains databases created related to a folder. Databases are document-based schema-less storage containers for any kind of data you want.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Workflows</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>User Interfaces</td><td>Contains user interfaces created related to a specific folder.
