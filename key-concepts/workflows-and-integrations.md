By designing efficient workflows, tasks are performed systematically, reducing manual intervention and enhancing productivity. Integrations, on the other hand, enable seamless communication between different tools and platforms, ensuring data consistency and accessibility. Together, they facilitate a cohesive environment where business processes are optimized, leading to improved efficiency and effectiveness.
