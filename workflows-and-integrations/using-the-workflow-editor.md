# Using the Workflow Editor

The Workflow Editor offers an easy-to-use interface for creating and modifying workflows. It simplifies the process compared to the earlier 'Model Designer' in the Lucy app.

## Key Features in the Workflow Editor&#x20;

In the workflow editor, users have the ability to create complex workflows by interconnecting different blocks.

In the workflow editor, every workflow creation process begins with a trigger block, followed by one or more action blocks.
{% endhint %}

Here are the key features in the Workflow Editor:

1. Trigger Blocks
2. Action Blocks

### **1. Trigger Blocks**

Trigger Blocks initiate the workflow process. They act as the starting point and are designed to respond to specific events or conditions. For example, a trigger block can be set up to activate when a new email is received, a form is submitted.

When you construct a workflow using the Workflow Editor, you'll encounter four distinct types of trigger blocks.

1. Cron Trigger Blocks
2. Message Trigger Block
3. Email Trigger Block
4. Database Trigger Blocks

#### Cron Trigger Blocks

Cron triggers allow you to schedule workflows to run at specific intervals. For instance, it's possible to set up a workflow to execute on an hourly basis. Cron triggers enable scheduled execution of tasks, enhancing automation and efficiency.

These are the available Cron Triggers in Lucy:

#### Message Trigger Block

A message trigger is used to start workflows in response to messages from popular messaging applications _e.g., Telegram._ For example, you can set up a workflow to run whenever a message is received from a bot.

#### Email Trigger Block

Email trigger is used to start workflows when an email is sent by someone.

#### Database Trigger Blocks

Database triggers start workflows when changes happen in a database. For example, they can activate a process when new information is added to a table.

The image below displays all the trigger blocks currently available in Lucy.

### 2. Action Blocks

Action Blocks are the steps that take place after a workflow has been triggered. Each action block performs a specific task, such as sending an email, updating a database record. You can string together multiple action blocks to create complex automations tailored to your needs.

This image showcases the action blocks that Lucy offers. You can find these blocks quickly by entering the block name in the search box or by filtering them by category.
