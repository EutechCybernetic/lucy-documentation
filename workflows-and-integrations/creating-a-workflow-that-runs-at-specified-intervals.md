# Creating a Workflow that Runs at Specified Intervals

Automating tasks is crucial for streamlining your workflow and increasing efficiency. One effective method is to schedule tasks to run at specific intervals. By setting up these recurring actions, you can automate repetitive processes, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.

Set your workflow to run:

* **Every minute:** For tasks that require frequent updates or monitoring.
* **Every five minutes:** For moderately frequent tasks.
* **Every hour:** For tasks that need to be executed periodically throughout the day.
* **Every day at midnight:** For daily tasks or reports that need to be generated overnight.
