# Creating a Workflow to Run When an Email is Received

Automating tasks can significantly enhance workflow efficiency. One powerful method is creating a workflow that triggers upon receiving an email.

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have created a forwarding email address  in this format '<\<Your organization name>>**@inbox.lucyhq.com**' (e.g., collins\_k.eutech@inbox.lucyhq.com).

## Configuring Email Forwarding

We cannot directly listen to incoming emails. However, we can configure forwarding of incoming emails to another address.

Steps to Set up Email Forwarding

1. Log in to your Gmail account that you want to forward emails from.
2. In the top right, click **Settings** and click **See all settings.**
3. Click the **Forwarding and POP/IMAP** tab.
4. In the "Forwarding" section, click **Add a forwarding address**.
5. Enter the email address you want to forward emails to _e.g., collins\_k.eutech@inbox.lucyhq.com._
6. Click **Next**.
