# Creating Workflows

Workflows enable the creation of automated sequences of actions that interact with various applications, allowing for efficient and streamlined processes. A workflow is initiated by a trigger event, followed by the execution of predetermined actions in response to that event.

Users can easily create their workflows using the Workflow Editor. Using the Workflow Editor, you can create workflows that start when:

1. Data is added to a database
2. You receive an email
3. You receive a message from a chatbot
4. The workflow is initiated at specified intervals
