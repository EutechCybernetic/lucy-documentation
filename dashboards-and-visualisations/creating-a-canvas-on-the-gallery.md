# Creating a Canvas on the Gallery

## <mark style="color:blue;">Canvas</mark>

In Lucy, a **Canvas** is your space or dashboard where you can add widgets to create and organise your work, and visualise your data. You can see all your Canvases, as well as the Canvases created by others by going to the **Gallery** tab on the sidebar in Lucy.&#x20;

Letâ€™s create a Canvas in Lucy.

2. Click the + button. A wizard will pop up to start creating a new Canvas.
3. Click **Next**.
4. Select a colour theme for your Canvas.
   1. To select a colour theme for your Canvas from the pre-selected colour themes, click on the required box. Selected colour theme will be shown under the **Header Colour** section.&#x20;
   2. If you need to select a custom colour theme, click on the colour code in the **Header Colour** section to open the colour picker to select a colour of your own.
5. Under **Background Image**, click the **Search** icon to select a background wallpaper for your Canvas.
   1. To select an image from the available collection, first, type the required keyword in the **Search Images** box to search for the image and then select it.
   2. To select your own image as the background of your Canvas, click **Upload your image** and upload your own image.
6. Enable the **Blur the background** option to blur the applied background of your Canvas if necessary.
7. Click **Next**.
8. Provide a **Name** for your Canvas.
9. Grant Access to the Canvas.
   1. Select a User Group (e.g., System Administrators) if you wish to grant access to specific groups.
   2. To grant access to anyone, do not select a user group.
10. Click **Next**. A new Canvas will be created and listed on the Gallery page.&#x20;
11. Click **Go to your Canvas now** button to jump into your Canvas. The newly created Canvas will open in a new tab in your browser.

> **Note:** You can always change the properties of the canvas, such as **Colour Theme**, **Background Image**, and **Name**, later at any time.

Below is a short video that guides you on creating a new canvas.
