# Adding Widgets onto Your Canvas

This article shows you the process of adding a widget you've designed onto an existing dashboard/canvas. Widgets on your dashboard visually represent your data in real-time. This allows you to personalise your dashboard by incorporating widgets that align with your specific needs.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_You need to have a Canvas created to add widgets to it._
{% endhint %}

Refer to the below article to gain insights into creating a canvas if you have no idea how to create one.

There are two ways to add a widget onto a canvas:

1. [Adding a Widget Directly onto Your Canvas](adding-widgets-onto-your-canvas.md#adding-a-widget-directly-onto-your-canvas)
2. [Adding a Widget from the Widget Designer Page](adding-widgets-onto-your-canvas.md#adding-a-widget-from-the-widget-designer-page)

The following example shows the Current Monthly Energy Usage widget that can be used to show the current month's energy consumption.
