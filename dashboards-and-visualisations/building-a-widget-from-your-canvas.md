# Building a Widget from Your Canvas

If you can't find that specific widget on the widget browser, no worriesâ€”you can just build it yourself!

After building it, you can always add it to your canvas later at any time.

**What is a Widget Browser?**

A widget browser is a interface that allows users to explore, search, and locate various widgets when selecting widgets to be added to a canvas. In addition, it allows to generate new widgets when none meet their specified criteria.

Let's see how to build a widget easily right from your canvas.

1. On the app **homepage**, head to the **Gallery** tab on the left sidebar.
2. Choose the canvas.
3. If there is a list of canvases on the Gallery, you can search for the required Canvas by typing its name/partial name under **Search Canvases.**
4. Click on the canvas to open it in a new window
5. On the canvas, click on the **Add Widget** button. The widget browser will open.
6. Search and locate your widget.
   1. Type in the **widget's name** in the search box.
   2. If you don't find any matching widgets in the search results, click the **Build a new Widget** button that appears.
7. Select a template to build the widget.
8. Click Edit this template. Your widget will open on the widget designer page, allowing you to apply the required customisations and design your widget.
