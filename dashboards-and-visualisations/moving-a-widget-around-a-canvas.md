# Moving a Widget around a Canvas

Within the canvas, users can rearrange widgets, moving them to different areas on the canvas to better organise and customise the layout according to their preferences.

To move a widget:

1. On the app **homepage**, head to the **Gallery** tab on the left sidebar.
2. Choose the Canvas containing the widget to be moved.
3. If there is a list of canvases on the Gallery, you can search for the specific Canvas by typing its name/partial name under **Search Canvases.**
4. Click on the canvas to open it in a new window.
5. Click on the widget and drag it to the desired area on the canvas you wish to place it.
6. The widget will be placed on its new position.
