# Customising a Canvas

Beyond customizing individual widgets, you can personalise your canvas further by:

* **Adding sidebar items:** Organize your content into sections and sub-sections, making it easier for users to navigate and find the information they need.
* **Branding your canvas:** Incorporate your logo and customise the colors of the sidebar and canvas header.
* **Managing access:** Control which user groups or individuals can view specific sidebar items or the entire canvas.

## Create a Sidebar Item

There are two ways to create a sidebar item on your canvas.

1. Create a New Sidebar Item
2. Select from Existing Item

### Create a New Sidebar Item



### Select from Existing Item

If you have existing items created in another canvas, you can add those in to your canvas.
