# Dashboards and Visualisations

A dashboard or canvas provides a space where you can add widgets to visualise data. It plays a crucial role in simplifying complex data and enhancing decision-making processes, allowing users to monitor real-time data and track what's happening in their business or system.&#x20;

Dashboards simplify data presentation by using charts, graphs, maps, and other visual elements to convey information in a format that is easily digestible and understandable.
