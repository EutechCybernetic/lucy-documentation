# Working with the Widget Designer

The Widget Designer offers a user-friendly, no-code interface for designing and customising user interfaces.

This allows you to tailor the appearance, behavior, and content of a user interface to your specific needs. Customisation options include changing colors, titles, font sizes, connecting data sources, and more.

This article shows the basic functionalities of the widget designer.

{% hint style="info" %}
A basic understanding of creating [folders](../), [databases](../databases/creating-and-editing-databases/), and [user interfaces ](designing-a-user-interface/)is recommended before proceeding with this article.
{% endhint %}

### Accessing the Widget Designer

There are three primary ways to[ design a user interface:](designing-a-user-interface/)

1. [Visualise Data:](designing-a-user-interface/designing-a-user-interface-to-visualise-information.md) Design charts and graphs to display information visually.
2. [Record Data:](designing-a-user-interface/designing-a-user-interface-to-capture-user-feedback.md) Create forms to collect user input.
3. [Start from Scratch: ](designing-a-user-interface/designing-a-user-interface-from-scratch.md)Design user interfaces from the ground up.

You can use any of the above methods to open the desired user interface on the Widget Designer page.

For instance, let's use the "Record Data" option.

1. On the app **homepage**, go to **My Work** module on the left.
2. Search and select the required folder. Click on the folder to open it.
3. Navigate to the **User Interfaces** tab.&#x20;
4. Click the **Plus** icon and select **Record Data**.
5. Choose a data source. For the data source, you can select an existing Lucy Action or a database.
6. To select a database,
   1. Go to the Databases tab. A list of database will appear.
   2. Click on the desired database and click Select this source.
   3. Click Looks Good.
7. A form user interface will display on the widget designer page. The widget designer's Design mode is activated by default.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Basic Functionalities of the Widget Designer</mark>

Whenever you open the widget designer, its default mode will be the **Design** mode.

The widget designer has two modes:&#x20;

1. **Design** - Used to design and customise certain user interface.&#x20;
2. **Preview** - Allows you to see how your user interface will appear to your users, providing a live version to visualise any changes you've made.&#x20;

You can switch between the two modes as needed.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Features in the Widget Designer's Design Mode</mark>

The screen below displays the basic features of a widget designer in **Design** Mode.

{% hint style="success" %}
Some widget designer features will become available only after saving your user interface.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Form User Interface</mark>

A form consists of three customisable sections: a header, a body, and an item/field. Click on a section to open its properties panel for customisation.

All user interfaces, including forms, simple cards, item lists, bar charts, etc., are customisable. Click individual section in a user interface to open their respective properties panel.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Configuring Properties of the Header Section</mark>

Users can customise the appearance of the header section on the widget designer page. _e.g., Add a title for the header section._&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">Sharing a User Interface</mark>

After designing your user interface, you can share it. There are multiple ways to do that: copying a shareable link to your clipboard, opening the user interface in a new page, adding the user interface to an existing canvas, sending the user interface via email, sending the user interface as a push notification to mobile app, and more.

Learn how to effectively share a user interface. Find the article here.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Saving a User Interface as a Template</mark>

Accelerate your user interface design by saving existing user interfaces as templates.

Explore how to save a user interface as a template from here:

{% endcontent-ref %}

### <mark style="color:blue;">Exporting a User Interface</mark>

Export saved user interfaces as JSON files.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Binding Data sources for Data Visualisation</mark>&#x20;

Some user interafecs such as bar charts, radial gauges require linking a data source to them. The purpose of this binding is to establish a connection between the data source (which contains the underlying data) and the user interface that is responsible for displaying data. This connection ensures that changes in the data source are automatically reflected in the widget, and vice versa, facilitating real-time synchronisation between the data and the user interface.

_e.g., A bar chart displaying sales figures for different products over a month._

Refer to this tutorial to learn how to bind a data source to a user interface.
