# Designing a User Interface from Scratch

This article is intended to guide you on designing and customising your own user interface using a pre-built Widget Template.

Pre-built widget templates are pre-designed templates that provide a foundation for creating user interfaces. They offer a starting point, saving you time and effort.&#x20;

Choose a template that cater your requirements. Then, you have the flexibility to make necessary adjustments, altering the widget's appearance by modifying elements such as colours, text, background images, connecting data sources to visualise data and more.

For instance, let's use the "**Simple Card**" widget template to design a user interface. This template allows to configure a background image, icon, title and a clickable button. Upon clicking the button, we can trigger a variety of actions, including:

* Opening an external link: Directs users to a specified website or webpage.&#x20;
* Opening an existing widget: Navigates users to another widget.&#x20;
* Executing a Lucy action: Initiates a specific Lucy action, such as sending a notification when the button is clicked.
* Opening an existing add-on: Launches a particular add-on.
* Opening a mobile screen: Launches a specific mobile screen, such as the Currency page, designed exclusively for mobile apps.

By leveraging this flexible template, we can create dynamic and interactive card-based interfaces that enhance user experience.

When creating a user interface to capture information using a Form template, you can always start from scratch, yet it is generally advisable to start creating a form from a database. See [Creating a User Interface to Capture User Feedback](designing-a-user-interface-to-capture-user-feedback.md) article to learn better.
