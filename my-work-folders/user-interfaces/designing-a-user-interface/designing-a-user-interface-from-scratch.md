# Designing a User Interface from Scratch

This article is intended to guide you on creating and customising your own widget using a pre-built Widget Template, e.g., Simple Card.

Pre-built widget templates are pre-designed components that provide a foundation for creating user interfaces. They offer a starting point, saving you time and effort. These templates typically include basic layouts, styles, and elements, ensuring a consistent look and feel.

Choose a template that cater your requirements. Then you have the flexibility to make necessary adjustments, altering the widget's appearance by modifying elements such as colours, text, background images, connecting data sources to visualise data and more.

When designing a user interface to capture information using a Form template, you can always start from scratch, yet it is generally advisable to start creating a form from a database. See [Designing a User Interface from a Database ](designing-a-user-interface-to-capture-user-feedback.md)article to learn better.
