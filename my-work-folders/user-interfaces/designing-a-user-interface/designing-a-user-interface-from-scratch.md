# Designing a User Interface from Scratch

This article is intended to guide you on designing and customising your own user interface.

To design your user interface, choose a pre-built widget template that suits your intended purpose. For instance, if you want to display a simple text and image, you could use a "Simple Card" template. If you want to embed a YouTube video, you could use a "YouTube Card" template. This approach can save time and effort, as you don't have to design everything from scratch.

**Widget Templates**

Widget templates are pre-designed templates that provide a foundation for creating user interfaces.&#x20;

For example, let's use the "**Simple Card**" widget template. This template allows to configure a background image, icon, title and a clickable button. Upon clicking the button, we can trigger a variety of actions, including:

* Opening an external link: Directs users to a specified website or webpage.&#x20;
* Opening an existing widget: Navigates users to another widget.&#x20;
* Executing a Lucy action: Initiates a specific Lucy action, such as sending a notification when the button is clicked.
* Opening an existing add-on: Launches a particular add-on.
* Opening a mobile screen: Launches a specific mobile screen, such as the Currency page, designed exclusively for mobile apps.

By leveraging this flexible template, we can create dynamic and interactive card-based interfaces that enhance user experience.
