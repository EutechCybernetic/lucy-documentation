# Exporting Data in a Database

With Lucy, you can export a database as a CSV file.

Let's see how to do it.

1. On the app **homepage**, go to the **My Work** tab on the left sidebar.
2. All the folders you have created, as well as those created by others, will be listed.
3. If you cannot locate the folder in the list, type in the folder name under **Search Folders.**
4. Click on the folder you wish to open.
5. Head to the **Databases** tab.
6. Search and click on the required **database**.
7. A spreadsheet view of your database will be opened in a new window.
8. Click **Export**.
9. Your database will be exported as a downloadable .CSV file.
