# Using an External Source as a Database

Lucy allows you to effortlessly build a database by directly utilizing an existing online data source, such as Google sheets or Excel, without the need to import data. It's like setting up your database with what's already thereâ€”no extra steps required.

When you link an external database, data is directly written and read from that source, even though it's presented in Lucy as just another database. Consequently, any changes you make to the data automatically reflect in the source database. The synchronization occurs seamlessly without requiring any additional actions on your part.

Let's see the process of creating a database using an external data source.

1. On the app homepage, head to the **My Work** tab on the left sidebar.
2. All the folders you have created, as well as those created by others, will be listed.
3. If you cannot locate the folder in the list, type in the folder name under **Search Folders.**
4. Click on the folder you wish to open.
5. Go to the **Databases** tab.
6. Click **+** button.
7. Click on the **Use External Source as Database** option.
8. Pick the **data source** you wish to create your database (Google sheet or Excel).
9. Choose the **account** associated with the data source you selected earlier.
10. Provide a suitable **name** for your database.
11. Click **Next**.
12. Select the desired **spreadsheet** from the available list of spreadsheets in your account.
13. Click **Next**.
14. Pick the required **sheet** of the spreadsheet you selected previously.
15. Click **Next**.
16. Now your database will be created and will be listed under the **Databases** tab.
