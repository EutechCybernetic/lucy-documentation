# Creating a Database Manually

Databases can be created either from the ground up or by choosing an existing template.&#x20;

When designing your database with an existing template, you can select a pre-designed template that comes with a predefined structure and build your database using it. This might require a few adjustments such as modifying available fields, adding more fields to tailor the database to your specific needs.
