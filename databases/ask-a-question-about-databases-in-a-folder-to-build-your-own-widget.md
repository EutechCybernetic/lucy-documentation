# Ask a Question about Databases in a Folder to Build Your Own Widget

In Lucy, you have the option to ask a question related to existing databases in a folder to create your very own widget. The system then pulls out the answers from the data in those databases and turns them into a cool visual widget for you.

Imagine we have a database storing asset information, and now, we aim to create a widget visualizing the count of operational assets for each asset category in a pie chart.

We can simply type in our question and generate a pie chart to display the result on a widget. Also, the system will pick the suitable database(s) based on the question asked to generate the desired result.
