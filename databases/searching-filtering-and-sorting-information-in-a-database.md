# Searching, Filtering, and Sorting Information in a Database

Searching and filtering are fundamental features that empower users to efficiently navigate databases and extract valuable insights. These functionalities play a crucial role in enhancing productivity, supporting decision-making processes, and maintaining the integrity of stored information.
