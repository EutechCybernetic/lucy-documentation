# Searching, Filtering, and Sorting Information in a Database

Searching and filtering are fundamental features that empower users to efficiently navigate databases and extract valuable insights. These functionalities play a crucial role in enhancing productivity, supporting decision-making processes, and maintaining the integrity of stored information. Additionally, users have the flexibility to arrange data records in either ascending or descending order.&#x20;

In this article, we'll guide you on how to search, filter, and sort information in a database.

There are two approaches to locating information in a database:

1. [Searching for Information by Entering a Search Term](searching-filtering-and-sorting-information-in-a-database.md#id-1.-searching-for-information-by-entering-a-search-term)
2. [Searching for Information by Entering a MongoDB Query](searching-filtering-and-sorting-information-in-a-database.md#id-2.-searching-for-information-by-entering-a-mongodb-query)

### <mark style="color:blue;">1. Searching for Information by Entering a Search Term</mark>

To search for data records by entering a search term:
