# Utilising Content-aware Autofill to Automatically Fill in Fields in Your Database

This article explains how to automatically fill in your database fields using the content-aware autofill feature in Lucy.

**Content-aware Autofill** is a powerful feature that uses AI (Artificial Intelligence) to automatically fill in data in a database based on existing columns. Simply provide initial row examples, and subsequently, this feature will fill columns automatically when new data is added or updated.

For instance, letâ€™s create a database to capture employee feedback and use this feature to automatically classify the feedback as 'Good' or 'Bad' and autofill the result in the database.&#x20;

Utilising Content-aware Autofill for database population involves several key steps.
